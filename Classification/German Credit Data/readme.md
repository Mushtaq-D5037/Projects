## German Credit Data
Supervised Classification Problem

#### Goal 
* Identifying credit risk

#### Overview of the Dataset
The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. 
In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. 
Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. 

#### My Approach
* ##### Identify whether the data is Imbalanced or Not
        ![Classification/German Credit Data/Images/](credit_risk.png)
As we can see 30% bad credit, 
so we can tell that this dataset is not an Imbalanced dataset
* ##### Perform EDA 
* ##### check correlation between the independent variables and removing them
* ##### running multiple machine learning models to pick best performing Model
* ##### Tuning Model to impore results
* ##### validating Model using confusion matrix,classification report and ROC_Curve
